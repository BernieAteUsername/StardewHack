# Tree Spread
Prevents trees from dropping their seeds and spreading on your farm. To compensate, trees will have a higher chance of having a seed.  

## Config
Note: run Stardew Valley once with this mod enabled to generate the `config.json` file.
* SeedChance: Chance that a tree will have a seed. Normally this is 0.05 (=5%). Default = 0.15 (=15%).
