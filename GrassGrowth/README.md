# Grass Growth
Normally long grass only spreads on digable soil. With this mod it can spread everywhere on your farm. Useful for the forest farm, where there's plenty of grass tiles, but the digable soil is scarce.

## Config
* DisableGrowth: Whether grass spreading should be suppressed entirely. Default = false.

## Known bugs
none

## Changes
#### 0.5:
* Added config options to disable grass spreading.
