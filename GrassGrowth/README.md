# Grass Growth
Allows you to fully configure how (fast) grass growths & spreads. Normally long grass only spreads on digable soil. With this mod it can spread everywhere on your farm. Useful for the forest farm, where there's plenty of grass tiles, but the digable soil is scarce.

## Config
Note: run Stardew Valley once with this mod enabled to generate the `config.json` file.
* DisableGrowth: Whether grass growth & spreading should be suppressed entirely. Default = false.
* GrowEverywhere: Whether grass spreads almost everywhere. If false, grass spreading is limited to digable tiles. Default = true.
* GrowthChance: The chance that grass growth or spreads. Default = 0.65 (=65%).
* SpreadChance: The chance for each neighbouring tile that the grass will spreads there. Default = 0.25 (=25%).
* DailyGrowth: The number of iterations that grass growth is applied per day (max=10). Default = 1.
* MonthlyGrowth: Additional iterations that grass growth is applied at the start of each month (max=100). Default = 40.
