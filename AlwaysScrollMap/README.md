# Always Scroll Map
Makes the map scroll past the edge of the map. Useful for:
* planting seeds while walking;
* doing out-of-bounds glitches;
* checking for out of bounds objects.

## Config
* Enabled: Should the mod be enabled upon loading the game? Default = true.
* ToggleScroll: The key used to toggle always scroll map. Default = OemSemicolon.

## Known bugs
* On the bus-stop map, the HUD also moves when scrolling past the edge of the map.
* On a day with falling leaves, the leaves disappear when scrolling past the west edge of the map.

## Changes
#### 0.3:
* Added a configurable toggle button to enable/disable this mod during the game.
