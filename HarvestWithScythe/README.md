# Harvest With Scythe
Allows you to harvest all crops and forage using the scythe. They can also still be plucked. Unlike other 'harvest with scythe' mods, this patch does not affect your savegame. So it is possible to revert to the old behavior by removing this patch. Make sure to also install the [Fix Scythe Exp](/FixScytheExp) mod. Otherwise, crops harvested with the scythe won't yield any experience points.

## Dependecies
* [Fix Scythe Exp](/FixScytheExp): for making sure that you earn farming experience when using the scythe. It also makes sure that harvesting sunflowers with a scythe also drops seeds.

## Config
none

## Known bugs
* Cutting weeds with the scythe is currently broken.
* Harvesting spring unions with scythe puts them directly into your inventory.
