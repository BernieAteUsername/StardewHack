# Harvest With Scythe
Allows you to harvest all crops and forage using the scythe. They can also still be plucked, without having to press a toggle button. Unlike other 'harvest with scythe' mods, this patch does not affect your savegame. So it is possible to revert to the old behavior by removing this patch. Otherwise, crops harvested with the scythe won't yield any experience points.

## Config
Note: run Stardew Valley once with this mod enabled to generate the `config.json` file.
* HarvestForage: Should the game be patched to allow harvesting forage with the scythe? Default = true.
* AllHaveQuality: Should quality be applied to additional harvest? Default = false.

## Known bugs
none

## Changes
#### 0.3:
* Removed dependecy on FixScytheExp. The bug patched by that mod has been fixed in StardewValley 1.3.25.
#### 0.5:
* There is no longer a difference in quality for additional harvest depending on whether it was harvested by hand or by scythe.
* Added option to configure whether additional harvest should receive a quality modifier.
* The HarvestSeeds option has been removed. The patch that ensures that sunflowers drop seeds when harvested with scythe will always be applied.
