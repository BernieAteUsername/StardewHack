# Stardew Hack

## Description
Library mod used by my other mods. Doesn't do much on its own.

## Used by
This library is used by the following mods:

* [Always Scroll Map](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2733):                   Makes the map scroll past the edge of the map.
* [Craft Counter](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2739):                       Adds a counter to the description of crafting recipes telling how often it has been crafted.
* [Fix Animal Tool Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3215):          When using the shears or milk pail, the animation no longer plays when no animal is nearby.
* [Grass Growth](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2732):                        Allows long grass to spread everywhere on your farm.
* [Yet Another Harvest With Scythe Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2731): Allows you to harvest all crops and forage using the scythe. They can also still be plucked.
* [Movement Speed](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2736):                      Changes the player's movement speed and charging time of the hoe and watering can.
* [Tilled Soil Decay](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2738):                   Delays decay of watered tilled soil.
* [Tree Spread](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3183):                         Prevents trees from spreading on your farm.
